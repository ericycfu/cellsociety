Refactoring Discussion:

Reduced some logic expression (mainly for the adjacency-checking methods for each shape of cells).

Eliminated some magic constants and assign them variables.

Eliminated passing lists in public methods (make it unmodifiable).

Eliminated some unused variables. 

Pulled out sub-methods from large methods to make the code more readable and ensure the unique task of each method.

Resolved errors in float number equality checks.
